<!-- 
    When the user clicks the button below, start a timer
    that changes the paragraphs text:
    - When the button is first clicked set the paragraph to
      "Timer Started..."
        - After 4 seconds, set the paragraph to "Timer Complete."

    If you get done too quickly, try to update the pargraph, so it's
    a countdown. 5...4...3...2...1...Timer Complete. This is
    much more advanced!
