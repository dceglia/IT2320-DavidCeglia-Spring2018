<!-- 
    Create a JavaScript object. Give it hard-coded values for 
    restaurantName, streetAddr, city, state, zip, phone, websiteURL.

    Add three methods: makeReservations, finishMeal, getFullAddress

    getFullAddress() should return the following strings concatenated together:
    streetAddr, city, state, zip (use spaces as commas as you normally would in an address)

    makeReservations() should output the following:
    "Thank you for making reservations at " + restaurantName + "<br><br>" +
    "<b>Location:</b><br>" + fullAddress +
    "<b>Time:</b><br>"

    finishMeal() should output "Thank you for dining at " + restaurantName + " Please " +
    "let us know how your meal was at " + websiteURL
